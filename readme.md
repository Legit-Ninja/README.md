Hi! My name is Ben Greenwood and I am currently a junior at Whitworth University. I really enjoy video games, and I would like to become a game designer.
I have experience in languages such as C++, Java, SQL, and I'm currently working on a project in Swift. I also have experience in the QA world, I took a 
class at Whitworth called Quality Assurance and we explored the different approaches to testing and documentation of bugs. My most recent project was a 
very simple website hosted by AWS (written in PHP) that connected to a relational database also hosted by AWS.
